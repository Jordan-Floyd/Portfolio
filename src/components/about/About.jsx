                    Flexibility has been a driving factor for my love of technology. 
                    I take to the fact that I can be in person or remote and explore my creativity in building.
                    I am opportunity focused and love the growth engineering offers. 
                    My strengths are fixing and finding optimal solutions to problems. I work well in teams as well as autonomously. 
                    The information that is derived from data allows me to understand ways to navigate complex problems and is the reason for why I enjoy being a software engineer. 
                    On my days off I'm an outdoor enthusiast. I ski, camp, and enjoy being on the beach. Iâ€™m also a gamer and love quality time with my family.
